# Enigma Machine

This was my final project for my European History class in that I took during my
Sophomore year of high school in 2023 (I decided to do a presentation on the Enigma
Machine and I made this as a demo). 

Anyway, I have made some small improvements to the code and if you happened
to stumble across this repository, feel free to use this for whatever purpose
you want.

## Features
 - A GUI to input your text
 - Plugboard
 - 3 Rotors

Input plaintext with the gui (or typing) and view the ciphertext in `stdout`

Spaces are not supported.
